This repository contains blog posts for my blog, [jisosomppi.me](http://jisosomppi.me), that are synced automatically by using [The WordPress <-> GitHub Sync plugin](https://github.com/mAAdhaTTah/wordpress-github-sync).

Add this YAML frontmatter to start of .md documents to enable automatic creation of blog posts:

``` yaml
---
post_title: 'Post Title'
layout: post_type_probably_post
published: true_or_false
---
```
